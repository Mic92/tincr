//! I/O readiness loop. Ports `linux/event.c` (`io_add`/`_set`/`_del`/
//! `event_loop`) and the per-platform splay-tree bookkeeping.
//!
//! The platform syscall surface lives in `epoll.rs` (and a future
//! `kqueue.rs`). The `OwnedFd` is the `epollset` static; the slot
//! index is `epoll_event.data.u64`.
//!
//! # The loop doesn't own fds
//!
//! `linux/event.c` does `epoll_ctl(epollset, ..., io->fd, ...)` — the
//! event loop never owns fds. The `connection_t` does, via
//! `c->socket`. The loop just tells the kernel "wake me when this fd
//! is readable."
//!
//! This means `EventLoop` stores `RawFd` per slot (so it can
//! reregister/deregister later), but doesn't `close()` on drop.
//! Closing is the `connection_t` equivalent's job.
